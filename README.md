# Bank-loan-analysis

# Project Overview
This project aims to analyze a bank’s loan portfolio by exploring loan data through various tools, providing data-driven insights to optimize decision-making and manage risks. The analysis identifies trends, patterns, and potential areas of improvement in loan approvals, disbursements, and defaults.

# Workflow and Methodology
Data Collection & Cleaning: Raw data was gathered and cleaned using Excel, automating repetitive tasks and ensuring consistency across the dataset.

SQL Database Development: Structured the cleaned data into an SQL database, allowing for optimized querying and data manipulation. SQL was utilized to extract critical information and derive meaningful insights by performing advanced queries, including aggregations, joins, and filtering.

# Data Visualization & Reporting:

Power BI: Created interactive dashboards, highlighting loan approval rates, default probabilities, and customer demographics. The visualizations helped in understanding key loan trends and performance metrics.
Tableau: Leveraged Tableau for more detailed visual analytics, offering deeper insights into the factors influencing loan approvals and defaults. These visual reports aided in tracking and monitoring loan health, providing an overview of critical KPIs.
Predictive Analysis: Using the insights from SQL and visualizations, the analysis focused on predictive trends that could help the bank enhance its risk management practices, reduce default rates, and improve loan disbursement strategies.

# Key Insights:
Loan Default Trends: Identified high-risk customer profiles based on loan types, income, and credit history, providing actionable recommendations for minimizing defaults.
Loan Approval Patterns: Highlighted factors that significantly affect loan approvals, enabling the bank to streamline the approval process and enhance customer satisfaction.
Portfolio Management: Offered a comprehensive overview of the loan portfolio's health, helping the bank make informed decisions on lending practices and resource allocation.

# Tools & Technologies Used:
SQL: Database creation and advanced querying.
Excel: Data cleaning and preprocessing.
